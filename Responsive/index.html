	  a first-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words
	  altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.Versions of the
	  Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was 
	  popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. Lorem ipsum was introduced 
	  to the digital world in the mid-1980s when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing
	  templates for its desktop publishing program PageMeker. </p>
